The #u-TBL system represents an attempt to use the
search and database capabilities of the Prolog programming
language to implement a generalized form
of transformation-based learning. In the true spirit
of logic-programming, the implementation is 'derived'
from a declarative, logical interpretation of transformation
rules. The #-TBL system recognizes four kinds
of rules, that can be used to implement various kinds
of disambiguators, including Constraint Grammar disambiguators
as well as more traditional 'Brill-taggers'.
Results from a number of experiments and benchmarks
are presented which show that the system is both flex-
" ible and efficient.
