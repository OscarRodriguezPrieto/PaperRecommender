This paper presents context-group discrimination, a disambiguation algorithm based on clustering.
Senses are interpreted as groups (or clusters) of similar contexts of the ambiguous word.
Words, contexts, and senses are represented in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued
space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity. Similarity in Word Space is based
on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to
the same sense cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a
training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application:
senses are induced from a corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge
sources. The paper demonstrates good performance of context-group discrimination for a sample
of natural and artificial ambiguous words.
