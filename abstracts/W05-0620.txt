In this paper we describe the CoNLL-
2005 shared task on Semantic Role Labeling.
We introduce the specification and
goals of the task, describe the data sets and
evaluation methods, and present a general
overview of the 19 systems that have contributed
to the task, providing a comparative
description and results.
