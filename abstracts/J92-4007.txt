Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987), argues that in most
coherent discourse, consecutive discourse elements are related by a small set of rhetorical
relations. Moreover, RST suggests that the information conveyed in a discourse
over and above what is conveyed in its component clauses can be derived from the
rhetorical relation-based structure of the discourse. A large number of natural language
generation systems rely on the rhetorical relations defined in RST to impose
structure on multi-sentential text (Hovy 1991; Knott 1991; Moore and Paris 1989; Rosner
and Stede 1992). In addition, many descriptive studies of discourse have employed
RST (Fox 1987; Linden, Cumming, and Martin 1992; Matthiessen and Thompson 1988).
However, recent work by Moore and Paris (1992) noted that RST cannot be used as
the sole means of controlling discourse structure in an interactive dialogue system, because
RST representations provide insufficient information to support the generation
of appropriate responses to "follow-up questions." The basic problem is that an RST
representation of a discourse does not fully specify the intentional structure (Grosz and
Sidner 1986) of that discourse. Intentional structure is crucial for responding effectively
to questions that address a previous utterance: without a record of what an utterance
was intended to achieve, it is impossible to elaborate or clarify that utterance. 1
