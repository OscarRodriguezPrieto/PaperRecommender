A syntax-directed translator first parses
the source-language input into a parsetree,
and then recursively converts the tree
into a string in the target-language. We
model this conversion by an extended treeto-string
transducer that have multi-level
trees on the source-side, which gives our
system more expressive power and flexibility.
We also define a direct probability
model and use a linear-time dynamic
programming algorithm to search for the
best derivation. The model is then extended
to the general log-linear framework
in order to rescore with other features
like n-gram language models. We
devise a simple-yet-effective algorithm to
generate non-duplicate k-best translations
for n-gram rescoring. Initial experimental
results on English-to-Chinese translation
are presented.
