Broad-coverage corpora annotated with
semantic role, or argument structure, information
are becoming available for the
rst time. Statistical systems have been
trained to automatically label semantic
roles from the output of statistical
parsers on unannotated text. In this paper,
we quantify the eect of parser accuracy
on these systems' performance, and
examine the question of whether a 
atter
\chunked" representation of the input
can be as eective for the purposes
of semantic role identication.
